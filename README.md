# SecuronisLive-Build2.5-GNOME
Securonis iso build configs for version 2.5 GNOME desktop

Before building, add the skel directory from here https://github.com/Securonis/SecuronisDesktopGnome, otherwise the gnome desktop will be missing. I did not include the skel file here because it is too big and complicated.

This is just an alternative desktop. The default desktop of Securonis is MATE, so I can't work much on the GNOME desktop. Be aware that it will be less stable than the MATE version.
